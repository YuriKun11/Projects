# Note:

Due to confidentiality agreements, I’m unable to share live links or source code for some of the full-stack systems I’ve developed.

However, I’ve included screenshots (with all sensitive information removed) to showcase the interfaces, features, and design of the applications I built. These systems were fully developed by me — both frontend and backend — demonstrating my experience with full-stack development.
